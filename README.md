# TicTacToe project

Fork of https://github.com/infohoschie/arm-cortex-m0-cmake-start

Students: Simon Blum, Max Rodler, Ben Oeckl, Paul St√∂ckle

## How to build/run the project
### Using CMake and qemu directly

### Using the provided Makefile

### Using Docker

## Compile time configurations
The project has a few options that can be changed before compilation.
- Number of rows (default is 4)
- Number of columns (default is 4)
- Unicode support (default is "ON")

These can be set by:
### Directly passing to CMake
When configuring the project the default command `cmake --preset arm-cortex-m0-{unix/mingw}` can be
appended by:
- for the number of rows: `[...] --DCELLS_PER_COL=$(NUMBER)`
- for the number of cols: `[...] --DCELLS_PER_ROW=$(NUMBER)`
- for unicode support: `[...] --DENABLE_UNICODE=$(ON/OFF)`

### Using the included Makefile
When using the Makefile to configure/build the project variables can be passed like this:
- for the number of rows: `make ROWS=$(NUMBER)`
- for the number of cols: `make COLS=$(NUMBER)`
- for unicode support: `make UNICODE=$(ON/OFF)`

Due to the way the Makefile is structured, these may also be passed when using e.g. `make run`.
However please note, that in order for changes to take affect the build directory may have to be deleted.
This can be done using `make clean` or by manually deleting the directory.
