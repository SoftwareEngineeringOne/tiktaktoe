The architecture is interrupt-\/based and with the use cases package divided. The program starts at \doxylink{main_8c}{main.\+c}. This file is only used for restarting and shutting down the system. The program can run infinitely, dependent on the users actions. Package descriptions are following\+:\hypertarget{md__2github_2workspace_2Architecture_autotoc_md27}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Hardware Abstraction Layer ({\ttfamily hal})}{Hardware Abstraction Layer ({\ttfamily hal})}}\label{md__2github_2workspace_2Architecture_autotoc_md27}
The hardware abstraction layer package gives the developer the possibility to call neutral and machine-\/independent functions without knowing the hardware implementation. \textbackslash{} \textbackslash{} A specialty in this package are the interrupts. They make a user and time action-\/based system possible. It is the only component that calls functions outside the hal.\hypertarget{md__2github_2workspace_2Architecture_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Game Logic ({\ttfamily logic})}{Game Logic ({\ttfamily logic})}}\label{md__2github_2workspace_2Architecture_autotoc_md28}
The logic package is the most important part of the game. It manages the process of the game.\hypertarget{md__2github_2workspace_2Architecture_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Output ({\ttfamily presentation})}{Output ({\ttfamily presentation})}}\label{md__2github_2workspace_2Architecture_autotoc_md29}
The presentation package abstracts the whole output that is shown to the user. It simplifies the UART transmission.\hypertarget{md__2github_2workspace_2Architecture_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Utilities ({\ttfamily util})}{Utilities ({\ttfamily util})}}\label{md__2github_2workspace_2Architecture_autotoc_md30}
The util package includes independent (from another) helpers that are used from several packages.
