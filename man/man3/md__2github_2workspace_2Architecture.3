.SH NAME
md__2github_2workspace_2Architecture \- Architecture 
.PP


.PP
The architecture is interrupt-based and with the use cases package divided\&. The program starts at \fBmain\&.c\fP\&. This file is only used for restarting and shutting down the system\&. The program can run infinitely, dependent on the users actions\&. Package descriptions are following:
.SH "Hardware Abstraction Layer (\fRhal\fP)"
.PP
The hardware abstraction layer package gives the developer the possibility to call neutral and machine-independent functions without knowing the hardware implementation\&. \\ \\ A specialty in this package are the interrupts\&. They make a user and time action-based system possible\&. It is the only component that calls functions outside the hal\&.
.SH "Game Logic (\fRlogic\fP)"
.PP
The logic package is the most important part of the game\&. It manages the process of the game\&.
.SH "Output (\fRpresentation\fP)"
.PP
The presentation package abstracts the whole output that is shown to the user\&. It simplifies the UART transmission\&.
.SH "Utilities (\fRutil\fP)"
.PP
The util package includes independent (from another) helpers that are used from several packages\&.
